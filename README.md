# Griptape Chat Demo

The demo uses [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for the frontend and [Griptape](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape) for the backend.

## Get the code
```shell
git pull git@github.com:griptape-ai/griptape-chat.git
cd griptape-chat
```

## Setting up the runtime environment
Create file called .env in the root of this project directory and add the following content:
 ```shell
 OPENAI_API_KEY=your key here
 ```

*optional: if you want to run this on a port other than the default gradio port of 7860 you  can add 
GRADIO_PORT=<your port here> to the .env file as well*

### OpenAI API Key
We'll need to obtain our OpenAI API key. Follow the steps below to do so:

1. Head to [OpenAi's official website](https://platform.openai.com/) and either create or login to your account.
Once you are logged in, click on the "Personal" text on the top right of your browser and then click on 
"View API keys" from the context menu that appears.

1. Click on "+ Create new secret key" and give it a name.
1. Copy the key and paste it in the .env file in the root directory of this project. Replacing "your key here" 

### Accessing a Structure From the Cloud
To use a structure from the cloud, enter the keys in your .env file, the .env.example file serves as an example to copy and paste to your own .env file. 
- for more information on cloud structures access the [Griptape-CLI] (https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-cli)
- for a simple example of an emulated structure see this simple example of a [Cloud-Agent](https://github.com/alvarodls-gp/griptape-gradio-chatbot-structure)
